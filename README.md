# fcc-bot

## Introduction

FCC International is building a bot and perhaps a webapp or site to host its bot, if you would like to participate which I very much encourage, please clone this repo. I will be adding a ssh key in time. Contact me [Joseph Burton] or the Admin for any questions. Please commit to a unique branch, and as in time someone will be in charge of merging into master. FCC International is young yet. But in a short time we will get traction. Thank everyone for participating and making this a fun and challenging experience for everyone. Learn as much as you can. Happy Coding!
